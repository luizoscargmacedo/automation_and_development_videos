# Automation testing videos of Mobile and Web Application.

# iOS Mobile UI Testing:
iOS Automated Testing using; Python, Appium and Selenium.
I developed a simple iOS Application using Swift in Xcode, just to provide a basic validation run (Smoke Testing).

# React Native (Part 1): Automation Study
Mobile; iOS and Android Testing on React Native app.

I modified one specific project that I found (Airbnb app), just to understand better the structure of functionalities and configuration (button, image, id, header, label, code and etc), consequently creating a better automation testing with quality validation (in the next post I will share the React Native app automation).

# Web Application Automated Testing using Ruby, Capybara with Cucumber
Running Selenium tests using Ruby, with Cucumber and Capybara. It follows Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology, this "Automation Testing" has an invalid ID on the fourth step of "Login Scenario", just to simulate better a specific situation when we can identify some error during the report validation.

I am always striving and studying to improve the ability to recommend several different possible approaches, using different combinations of testing tools and techniques with Agile Testing methods.

Results registered on Cucumber (Basic Report)

# Mutation Testing using Java, JUnit and Maven
PIT runs your unit tests against automatically modified versions of your application code. When the application code changes, it should produce different results and cause the unit tests to fail. If a unit test does not fail in this situation, it may indicate an issue with the test suite.

The quality of your tests can be gauged from the percentage of mutations killed.

It is a good practice to validate your Unit Testing with a mutant before CI/CD, or we can make it part of the CI process (be careful, each team needs to do a time impact analysis about mutation testing in your project).
